Project Description: Toy Store E-commerce Application

Purpose of the Database:
The database serves as the backbone of our toy store e-commerce application, 
facilitating the storage and management of crucial data required for seamless operations.
It is needed to ensure data integrity, accessibility, and scalability, allowing us to efficiently
handle product inventory, user accounts, orders, warranties, and returns. The database 
should provide a reliable foundation for the application to deliver a smooth and satisfying
shopping experience to customers while enabling effective management and decision-
making for administrators.

Users and Their Information Needs:
- Customers: Users browsing and purchasing toys. They require access to product 
information, pricing, warranty details, and return policies. They also need functionality 
for placing orders and initiating returns or warranty claims.
- Administrators: Staff managing the store's operations. They need tools for managing 
product inventory, processing orders, and overseeing warranty claims and returns. They 
also require access to sales analytics and reporting features to monitor performance and 
make informed business decisions.

Problems the System Should Solve:
1. Provide a user-friendly platform for customers to browse, select, and purchase toys 
online.
2. Ensure accurate inventory management to prevent overselling and stockouts.
3. Implement efficient order processing and fulfillment workflows to minimize delays.
4. Facilitate warranty claims and returns management/ manufacturer to resolve product 
defects and satisfy customer needs.
5. Deliver comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities for administrators to 
monitor sales trends, inventory levels, and customer satisfaction metrics.
